I used JScript Panel 3 and some sample code to make a working shuffle button
that can be toggled on and off in in foobar2000.

To use this code, make sure the JScript Panel 3 component is installed in your
instance of foobar2000. I use version 3.8.5, and have included it in my repo
since it has been abandoned.

Copy the contents of TogglableShuffleButton.js from my repo into an instance
of JScript Panel 3 in foobar2000. The script relies on 2 images, which I have
included in my repo for anyone to use. You can also use your own images (as
long as they have the same name) or edit mine as you see fit.

Make sure you copy the images into a folder whose location you can remember.
You will need to edit the JScript Panel 3 code to find the media in its new
location on your computer.
