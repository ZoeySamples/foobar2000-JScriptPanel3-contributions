Here is where I will upload some scripts I've made for JScript Panel 3 in
foobar2000. The source code for each script is in its own subfolder with
the necessary source media to make it work. I have also included a copy of
the version of JScript Panel 3 that I use, since the project has been
abandoned.

I use the 64-bit version of foobar2000. I'm not sure if these scripts will
work in the 32-bit version, nor if the JScript Panel 3 version I've included
also works in the 32-bit version.
