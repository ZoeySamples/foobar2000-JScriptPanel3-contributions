To use this code, make sure the JScript Panel 3 component is installed in your
instance of foobar2000. I use version 3.8.5, and have included it in my repo
since it has been abandoned.

Copy the contents of seekbar.js from my repo into an instance of JScript Panel
3 in foobar2000. It should work after hitting OK.
